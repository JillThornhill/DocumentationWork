Some absolutesly useless bumf to test with

Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was black as soot - Well now, that's really interesting
And everywhere that Mary wnt
His sooty foot he put - nah, tha's boring

Which made Jack and Jill fall down the hill and come home all sooty
So Jack went and climbed beanstalks instead

And I think I'm going insane.
