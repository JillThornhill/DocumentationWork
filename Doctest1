Some absolutesly useless bumf to test with

Mary had a little lamb

Its fleece was black as soot (Nah, not fleece, fleas!!!)
And everywhere that Mary went
His sooty foot he put (Like me, I always put my foot in it)


Which made Jack and Jill fall down the hill and come home all sooty
So Jack went and climbed beanstalks instead

And got eaten by a giant

And I think I'm going utterly insane.
In fact I'm sure of it
