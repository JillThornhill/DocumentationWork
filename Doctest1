Some absolutesly useless bumf to test with

Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was black as soot (Nah, not fleece, fleas!!!)
And everywhere that Mary wnt
His sooty foot he put (Like me, I always put my foot in it)

Which made Jack and Jill fall down the hill and come home all sooty

And I think I'm going utterly insane.
In fact I'm sure of it
